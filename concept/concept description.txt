Time Void

Idea:
In this game you will have to implement a degree of strategy to overcome the enemy by playing in the correct era, and strategically playing moves to counter act the enemy as well as conquer teritory

Win condition:
To win the game the player must try to occupy an entire time era before the enemy
The player can gain a tile by occupying it for a total of 3 moves, only the occupier of the tile may spawn characters in that tile

Game Loop:
the player will fight the enemy by playing new characters, the player will be able to spawn 1 new character per turn (these may be saved up to overwhelm the enemy)
the player can attack characters which, will reliably do 1 damage, if the enemy is defending it will recieve 1 extra defensem so 2 characters must attack it on the same turn
or the enemy can just move to a new tile
all actions are executed at the same time, so if 2 characters walk into a tile neither will move into the tile
the character can move to the opposite time but the time change will be locked for 2 turns so they should be used strategically

the archer    : can attack into any tile
the swordsman : moves to the tile they attack into
the shieldsman: defends the tile they are in and gains 2 defense points

the player can reoccupy an occupied tile by staying in it for 3 consecutive turns
(the same character does not have to occupy the tile, but it does have to be the same player/team)

assets:
i will be drawing most assets in the game, and if there are any images i can source on the internet i will be using them if it aligns with my art style
i will however be drawing most assets as animations will be difficult to get online like i want them to be
